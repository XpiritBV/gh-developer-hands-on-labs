# Creating your first Action Workflow
In this hands-on lab your will create your first GitHub Action Workflow and learn how you can use Actions to automate tasks in your software development lifecycle. If you like more background information, please refer to the [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) pages on GitHub Docs. Good luck! üëç

This hands on lab consists of the following steps:
- [Creating the workflow](#creating-the-workflow)
- [Viewing your workflow results](#viewing-your-workflow-results)
- [If time permits: Only trigger workflow when a change is made to the website](#if-time-permits-only-trigger-workflow-when-a-change-is-made-to-the-website)
- [If time permits: Only trigger workflow on new issue created](#if-time-permits-only-trigger-workflow-on-new-issue-created)
- [If time permits: Create a Matrix build for release and debug](#if-time-permits-create-a-matrix-build-for-release-and-debug)

## Creating the workflow
1. Work inside your current repository or create a new repo
2. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
3. In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `github-actions-demo.yml`.
4. Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml` file:
```YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Create` a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click `Propose new file`.

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

## Viewing your workflow results
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click `Actions`.

3. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

4. From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

5. Under `Jobs` , click the `Explore-GitHub-Actions` job.

6. The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:

## If time permits: Only trigger workflow when a change is made to the src directory

See: [Workflow syntax for github actions - on push/pull - request paths.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths)

1. Create a src directory
1. Change the workflow to only trigger on changes in that directory
1. Commit the workflow
1. Change a file inside of the src directory and see that it does __not__ trigger the workflow
1. Change a file in the root of the repository and see that it __does__ trigger the workflow
```
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on:
  push:
    paths:
    - 'src/*'
jobs:

...
...
```

## If time permits: Only trigger workflow on new issue created
Configure and test this setup:
See: [Webhook events and payloads - Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#issues)
```
...
...

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

...
...
```

## If time permits: Create a Matrix build for release and debug
Configure and testthis setup:
See: [Workflow Syntax - Jobs - Matrix Strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix)

```
...
...

Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    strategy:
      matrix:
        configuration: [debug, release]
    steps:
    - run: echo "üîß Building the cofiguration ${{ matrix.configuration }}."

...
