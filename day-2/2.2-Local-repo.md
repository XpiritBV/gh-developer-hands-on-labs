# Local repository
For this exercise we will use a local git repository and do everything locally.

## Create a local repository

1. Navigate to the directory where you will place your practice repo (cd .. to get back to the parent folder). 
2. Create a new directory and initialize it as a git repository: git init practice- repo 
3. CD into your new repository: cd practice-repo 
4. Create an empty new file named README.md: o Bash: touch README.md o PowerShell: Out-File README.md 
5. Add and commit the README.md file.

__Bash:__
``` sh
for d in {1..6}; do touch "file${d}.md"; git add "file${d}.md"; git commit -m "adding file ${d}"; done 
```
__PowerShell:__
``` pwsh
for ($d=1; $d -le 6; $d++) { Out-File file$d.md; git add file$d.md; git commit -m "adding file$d.md"; } 
```

## Revising your last commit
1. Create a new file (see below)
2. When you are adding files to the previous commit, they should be in the staging area. Move your file to the staging area: git add file7 .md 
3. git commit --amend 
4. The text editor will open, allowing you to edit your commit message. 

__Commands:__
Bash: `touch file7.md`  
PowerShell: `Out-File file7.md`

## Reset soft
1. View the history of our project: git log --oneline --decorate 
2. Identify the current location of HEAD. 
3. Go back two commits in history: git reset --soft HEAD-2 
4. See the tip of our branch (and HEAD) is now sitting two commits earlier than it was before: git log --oneline --decorate 
5. The changes we made in the last two commits should be in the staging area: git status 
6. All the files still exist locally: is 
7. Let's remove the extra file we created earlier: git rm --cached file7.md 
8. Now, we'll re-commit these changes without the extra file: git commit -m "re-add file 5 and 6" 

## Reset mixed
1. Once again, we will start by viewing the history of our project: git log --oneline 
2. Go back one commit in history: git reset HEAD-
3. See where the tip of the branch is pointing: git log --oneline --decorate 
4. The changes we made in the last commit have been moved back to the working directory: git status 
5. All the files still exist locally: is 
6. Move the files to the staging area before we can commit them: git add file5.md file6.md 
7. Re-commit the files: git commit -m "re-add file 5 and 6" 

## Reset hard
1. Start by viewing the history of our project with: git log --oneline 
2. Reset to the point in time where the only file that existed was the README.md: `git reset --hard <SHA>`
3. See that all of the commits are gone: git log --oneline 
4. Notice your working directory is clean: git status 
5. See that the only files in your repository are the README.md and file7.md: is 

## Cherry-pick a commit
1. Find the commit ID where you added 'file4.md': `git reflog`
1. Cherry-pick that commit: `git cherry-pick <SHA>`

## Directional reset:
1. View the history of everywhere HEAD has pointed: `git reflog`
1. Reset to the point in time where the original `file6.md` was created: `git reset --hard <SHA>`
1. See you restored history: `git log --oneline`

## Setup the rebase
1. Find the SHA of the initial commit: git log --oneline 
2. Reset to the SHA of the initial commit: git reset --hard SHA 
3. Create a new branch and check out to it: git switch -c rebase-me 
4. Cherry-pick files 4-6 onto the rebase-me branch using the reflog. 
5. Switch to main: git switch main 
6. Cherry-pick files 1-3 onto the main branch using the ref log. 
7. Look at your history: git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all 
8. If you merged now, it would be a recursive merge.
